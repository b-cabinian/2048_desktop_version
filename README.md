# 2048_desktop_version
This is a desktop version of the 2048 game, made with Java and JavaFX. 

The game front end is meant to look as close as possible to the original 2048 layout https://play2048.co/

The project has two known bugs:
- A player loses when the screen is completed filled with tiles. In the original game, if the screen was full but they could still combine tiles, the game would not end.
- If the game is played too quickly, the JavaFX animation can't keep up and the tiles no longer move to the right locations. 

Starting a new game.mp4 shows how a new game can be started.
